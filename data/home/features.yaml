  - title: "Verifiable Computation"
    text: >
      Lurk programs prove that a computation was performed correctly. This
      allows reliable outsourcing and verification of computation.

  - title: "Zero Knowledge"
    text: >
      Lurk allows users to prove knowledge without revealing anything about
      what is being proved other than the public inputs.

  - title: "Content-Addressable Data"
    text: >
      Every Lurk Program has a unique content identifier (CID), enabling
      integration with IPFS and IPLD.

  - title: "Turing-Completeness"
    text: >
      Lurk proofs are not subject to the limitations of traditional
      fixed-circuit SNARKs, and can (within hardware and run-time constraints)
      take any program as input and produce an output and a proof.

  - title: "Higher-Order Functions"
    text: >
      Higher-order functions can take one or more functions as input and return
      a function as output. They can be used to create new functions, modify
      existing ones, or even generate entire programs.

  - title: "Computation over private data"
    text: >
      Lurk expressions can take private data as inputs to functons and return
      provably correct outputs without compromising data privacy.
